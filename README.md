Code is working fine but needs to be modified, because I added some shit that is not requiered if you only wan't to create a "bridge" between your Discord and Minecraft chat.

Discord Chat:

Minecraft Chat:

With join and leave Messages.

To run you will need a Discord-Bot Token, a Webhook, where all messages will be send, also the channel Id of that channel.
